<p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. 
Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: 
a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a 
paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, 
the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is 
what constitutes a paragraph.</p>
